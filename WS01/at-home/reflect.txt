In Lab 1, I learnt about internal and external linkage , how to use extern keyword and static variable which lasts upto whole lifetime of the program.
I also learnt how to use header guards to avoid the redundancy.
Also, to use dynamic memory allocation to accept the user provided string of any length.
I learnt how to use a variable which is defined in a different translation unit.


•	the difference between internal and external linkage using examples from your code
External linkage is denoted by 'extern' in declaration of the entity in a scope within another transaltion unit. Whereas, entities declared in internal linkage
are visible to the scope of its own transalation unit but invisible outside that transalation unit.In my code, I used g_maxSize unsigned int with
external linking which was declared in string.h and defined in string.cpp. To be noted: We dont have to write extern in the definition of the entity.

•	what are static variables and how were they useful in this workshop.
Static variables are denoted by the keyword 'static' with the variable which lasts the entire lifeitme of the program.
I used them to initialize the counter varibale in the free helper operator function.

•	the changes that you made in upgrading your String class.
I updated str from array of 4 char including null character to a pointer to allocate dynamic memory.
I also allocated dynamic memory in String class constructor to copy the string provided.
