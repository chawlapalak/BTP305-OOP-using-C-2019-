In this lab, I learnt about quality code, rather than lots of numbers of code lines. I learnt how to read a set of characters
from a file in binary mode, and how to write a set of characters to a file in binary mode, processing
partitioned data on two threads, binding a function to its arguments.

This lab was very less number of lines, but useful in long run. And I had multiple problems even injust
those few lines because I did not pay attention that you asked for two or more threads.I 
was about to submit the home part by using only 1 thread, then I re did with 2 threads. I used bind function
by using cppreference website. I binded those two functions in arguments then. I also
commented the originally provided line in the .cpp file, in ordeer to convert the text file into
binary file as mentioned by you in the latest blackboard message.

•	why was necessary to use binary files in this workshop and how did you use them
because Binary files are only in binary digits and faster to process, read or write as compared
to text files. text files takes time to convert them back and forth.

•	why would be important to bind a function to its arguments,
 and how was it useful in this workshop
 We binded the function to its arguments because it restricts the function to not be much
 versatile and forces it to use the default arguments, which maakes it easier to use and faster.
 
•	the advantages of using multiple threads, 
and how did you accomplished multi-threading in this workshop
Threads are very fast as compared to regular process. Multi threading makes the process a lot
faster to complete.  I created two threads with the function provided to make it faster and 
later on joined those two threads.
	//converter(text, key, nbytes, Cryptor());

		auto ii = bind(converter, text, key, nbytes, Cryptor());
		std::thread thr1(ii);
		std::thread thr2
		([this]() 
			{ 
				encoded = !encoded;
			}
		);
		thr1.join();
		thr2.join();
