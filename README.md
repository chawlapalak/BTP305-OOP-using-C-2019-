 Object-oriented programming is a style of computer programming that solves problems using objects and relationships between them. 
 The objects are designed independently of one another and can be shared across a range of solutions that have similar requirements. 
 Object-oriented programming is well suited to application development, notably, large-scale application development. 

This chapter reviews the object-oriented programming paradigm, introduces some of the building blocks common to 
many object-oriented languages, reviews the role of the compiler and summarizes the topics covered in this volume.
